## Share a Workspace

To invite others into your workspace:

1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Either:
    - Copy and share the workspace invite link, or 
    - Enter the member's email, then click **Invite**.

Invited members will appear on the members list. Use the search bar to find members.

## Create a Role

To create a new role:

1. Go to **Settings > Roles**
2. Under **All Roles**, click on **+ Create Role**
3. Enter a role name
4. In the default **Permissions** tab, customize role access
5. Then, click **Save** when you have finished customizing

## Delete a Role

To delete a role:

1. Go to **Settings > Roles**
2. Click on the role you wish to remove
3. Go to the **Settings** tab, then click **Delete Role**
4. Click **Confirm** in the modal

Note: If a role is deleted, any member assigned to that role will be automatically reassigned to the default role. All except the **Admin** role can be deleted; there must always be at least one member assigned to this role at all times.

## Manage Member Roles

### Access Roles 

To access all roles and assigned members:

1. Go to **Settings > Roles**
2. Click any role to see and edit its settings and assignments

### Reassign Roles

To reassign a role: 

1. Go to **Settings > Roles**
2. Click on the role you want to assign
3. Go to the **Assignment** tab
4. Click **+ Assign to member** and select the member
5. Select the member you wish to assign the role to 
6. Click **Confirm** when prompted with modal to remove the role that was previously assigned to the member

Note: New members are assigned to the default **Member** role when they join and the permissions for this can be customized in the **Roles** page.

## Customize Permissions

You can customize what each role can see or do across objects, settings, and general application actions.

### Object 

Control access to records and fields:

- Under **All Objects**, choose permissions like **See Record**, **Edit Records**, **Delete Records**, or **Destroy Records** to apply them across all objects
- Under **Object-Level Permissions**, add custom rules for individual objects. These settings override the default set under **All Objects**.

To override parent permissions and apply stricter controls:

- Click **X** next to the permission to remove the parent rule
- Select the specific permissions you want this role to have for the selected object 
- To undo an override, click the orange **Undo** icon (circular arrow)

When finished, click **Finish** to save your changes.

### Settings 

You can manage a members' access to workspace settings in two ways:

- Granting full editing rights to all workspace settings by toggling **Settings All Access**, or 
- Enable permissions for specific settings (e.g., API keys, workspace preferences, users, roles, data model, security, workflows)

### General

Grant or restrict access to general actions:

- Toggle **Application All Access** to grant full application rights
- Enable or disable permissions like **Send Email**, **Import CSV**, and **Export CSV**
